    <div class="blog-comments-count-container-oob">
        <!--
            This container is included here so that when users delete or create a new comment, the comment count increases or decreases.
            In one of the previous commits I moved out 'comment-list-header' container out from this template and moved it into
            'blogs_detail.html', so whenever an HTMX request was initiated, the 'BlogDetailView' view returned 'list_comments.html' 
            which included all of the comments but the comment count stayed the same because it was not a part of the 'list_comments.html'
            template, but now with the hx-swap-oob attribute we can load comments after a successful HTMX request and update 
            the comment count header as well.
            I am also setting the 'visibility' property of the 'blog-comments-count-container-oob' container to hidden in 'comments.css', 
            so that when users initially go to the blog detail page there is no second comment count header at the bottom of the comments.
        -->
        <h3 
            id="blog-comments-count" 
            hx-swap-oob="true"
